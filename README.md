# AI-Based Intrusion Detection System for IoT/IIoT

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project focuses on the design and implementation of an AI-based learning model for an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**[cite: 6]. [cite_start]The goal is to protect complex environments including **Cloud Computing**, **Blockchain Networks**, and **IoT/IIoT Perception layers** from evolving cyber threats[cite: 7, 8, 9, 10].

[cite_start]The system is engineered to pre-process and analyze data from digital sensors to identify security breaches across various connectivity protocols[cite: 14, 15].



## 📊 Dataset: Edge-IIoTset
[cite_start]The project utilizes the **Edge-IIoTset**[cite: 16, 40]. [cite_start]This dataset contains fourteen specific attacks classified into five major threat categories[cite: 16]:
* [cite_start]**DoS/DDoS attacks** [cite: 17]
* [cite_start]**Information gathering** [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]**Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]**Injection attacks** [cite: 20]
* [cite_start]**Malware attacks** [cite: 21]

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
[cite_start]As per the software requirements, the implementation is **Python-based** and covers[cite: 36]:
* [cite_start]**Machine Learning/Deep Learning:** Deployment of a predictive classifier to provide threat intelligence[cite: 27, 37].
* [cite_start]**Data Splitting:** Utilization of a **Training set** for model learning/validation (15% of grade) and a **Testing set** for final evaluation (10% of grade)[cite: 38, 39].
* [cite_start]**Performance Metrics:** Analysis using Confusion Matrices and ROC curves[cite: 51].



## 🚀 Project Structure
[cite_start]Following the academic report structure, the repository is organized to support:
1. [cite_start]**Data Preprocessing:** Handling sensor data and connectivity protocols[cite: 14].
2. [cite_start]**Methodology:** Selection and architecture of ML/DL algorithms[cite: 47, 49].
3. [cite_start]**Comparative Analysis:** Performance evaluation against alternative models[cite: 30].

## 📖 How to Use
1. **Clone the Repo:** `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/IoT-Intrusion-Detection.git`
2. **Install Requirements:** `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`
3. [cite_start]**Data Setup:** Place the `Edge-IIoTset.csv` in the root folder (Note: This file is ignored by Git due to size)[cite: 40].
4. **Run Notebook:** Execute the cells in `Assignment.ipynb`.
